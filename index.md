# Introduction  
The search for political spectrum, i.e. a set of independent political dimensions which enable characterization of political positions in relation to one another, has long been a focus of political science research. While most commonly used models are primarily based on the left/right division dating all the way from the French Revolution, many political scientists argue it no longer accurately characterizes the political divisions of today ([1](https://www.perlego.com/book/532600/beyond-liberal-and-conservative-reassessing-the-political-spectrum-pdf), [2](https://ideas.repec.org/p/osf/socarx/tr8g5.html)). In this project, we propose to create a political spectrum empirically by leveraging the Quotebank dataset ([3](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437963.3441760)). Using topic and sentiment extraction applied to recent quotes of American politicians on the federal level, we will obtain their sentiments on current issues and perform dimensionality reduction to find the most divisive axes. Further analysis and interpretation of the resulting vector space will allow us to redefine the political spectrum based on the most contentious issues.
